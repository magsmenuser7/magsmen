                            as they grow, they quickly realize that they need to start thinking about their brand. That's when they need
                            brand consulting. A brand consultant can help businesses to articulate their values and create a unique

                          everything from market research and analysis to brand strategy and identity development. Digital marketers,

                          and managing online campaigns, creating digital content, and driving traffic to websites. While both brand
                          consultants and digital marketers play important roles in growth and marketing, they have different focus
